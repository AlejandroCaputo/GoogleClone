# Google Clone!
The objective with this project is to test my abilities with html and css to build a really simple google clone. This will help me to identify my weak points and work on them so i can get a little bit closer to the objective of being a versatile front-end developer ðŸ’».

My aproach ðŸ“œ :

 -  ðŸ’¾ Save all the **images and icons** i'll need for the project 
 - Analize the **structure of the google search page**
 - Make a **basic wireframe** of how i think it can me done
 - Create the **main structure in my html** ( Header, Footer..etc)
 - Fill in the structure with **buttons images and icons** ðŸŒ†.
 - Style and Organize  the **header** 
 - Style and Organize  the **Footer**
 - Style and Organize  the **Body**

Main problems i've found ðŸ’¡:

 - It's still not super clear to me the **implementation of flexbox**
 - Centering content in the middle of the page (solved)
 - I need to strenghten my layout abilities (**css grid**, flexbox...)
 - Problems getting the **footer** to stick allways down on the page
 - **images get deformed** when im using flexbox
